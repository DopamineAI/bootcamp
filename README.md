Documented code samples for learning Dopamine.ai API
## Samples Structure
Usually every use case would be located in it's own directory. a ReadMe file would explain generally what's going on in the use case. Some of the explanations are based on our graphic modeling language, that is explained [here](https://github.com/DopamineAI/bootcamp/blob/master/Dopamine%20Modeling%20Language.ipynb)
## Samples List
- [Sample 1](https://github.com/DopamineAI/bootcamp/blob/master/01.%20Simple%20Image%20Trade/Readme_jupyter.ipynb) : Trading an image
- [Sample 2](https://10.156.0.172:8889/notebooks/02.%20Single%20Entity%20AI%20Inference%20Service/ReadMe_jupyter.ipynb) : AI inference service, single entity
